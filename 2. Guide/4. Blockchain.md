## What is the blockchain?

- The blockchain `is a file` that `contains a list of bitcoin transactions`
- Everyone on the bitcoin network `shares a copy of this file`, and it `updates regularly` with the latest transactions

## Why is it called the blockchain?

- Blocks are linked together, which `prevents anyone from modifying blocks` that are `already in the chain`

## Where can I get a copy of the blockchain?

- You can get your own copy of a blockchain by `downloading the original bitcoin client`
- Once installed and running, the client `will connect to other nodes` on the network and `start downloading the blockchain`

## Where is the blockchain file stored on my computer?

- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/`
- Window: `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\`
- The actual blockchain data is `stored in files` with names like: `blk00000.dat`
