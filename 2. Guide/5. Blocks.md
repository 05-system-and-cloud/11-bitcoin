## What is a block in Bitcoin?

- A block is a `bunch of transactions` that have been `added to the blockchain`

## How are blocks formed?

- Blocks are `constructed during the process of mining`
- Miners `gather transactions from the memory pool` in to `a "candidate block"`, and to try and add this candidate block to the blockchain

### Block header

- Each candidate block is `given a block header`, which is basically `a bunch of metadata containing information` about the contents of the block
- The details of the block header fields includes
  . `Version`: Version number for the block
  . `Previous Block`: `An identification number for the previous block` that we want to build upon
  . `Merkle Root (most important)`: A fingerprint for all the transactions in the block (basically all of the transactions hashed together)
  . `Time`: The current time
  . `Target`: The `value that miners work with` to try and add this block to the blockchain

## How are blocks added to the blockchain?

- To add a candidate block to the blockchain, you `hash the data in the block header + nonce (an extra number)` and hope that the `result is below a certain target value`
- The target is `calculated from the difficulty`, which is a value set by the bitcoin network to regulate `how difficult it is to add a block of transactions to the blockchain`
- If the first nonce `doesn't work (starting at 0)`, keep `incrementing it` and hashing the block header `until you find a correct nonce` (block hash that is below the current target value)
