## Best Wallets

- There are 3 types of wallets
  . Desktop wallets (prefer)
  . Mobile wallets (less features than desktop wallets)
  . Hardware wallets (best security but take cost)

## Setup

### 1. Download and install

### 2. Write down the seed

- During the initial setup of your wallet you will be `given a 12 or 24 word seed`
  Ex:
  such - today - oxygen - pupil
  knee - feature - roof - layer
  fork - glass - ten - vapor

- This seed is the `source of all your keys and addresses`. Therefore, it allows you to `recover all of your bitcoins` if you end up losing your wallet for whatever reason

## What does a wallet do?

- A wallet does three main things
  . `Manages the addresses` required for receiving bitcoins
  . `Manages the corresponding private keys` for sending bitcoins
  . `Creates transactions and sends` them in to the network

- When you send bitcoins someone else, your wallet will `create a new transaction that unlocks an amount of bitcoin` you've received `using the corresponding private key`, and `locks up an amount of bitcoin to someone else's address`
